## About the Project 



#### This project was for my maker lab class; the assignment was to make a guide showing how an airplane was made. Below are the rough copy and the colouring process. My goal was to make it informative for kids to learn about planes and how it works and make them fun for the parents. I have used bright colour platelets to bring attention to the preliminary information and keep the kid's attention. Having tips here and there to help make a better airplane.
