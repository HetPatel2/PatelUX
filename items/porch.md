#### This app was made for my UX 201 Maker lab project to create a passionate box that is used. My group and I make a private porch box to protect the users' packaging from thieves. I have Desing the app; locations to be simple and easy to use as most apps for these products are complications of the users to a user. Keep it simple and easy navigation.
