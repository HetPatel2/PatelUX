## Hello
##### My name is Het Patel, and I am a second student at Laurier in the Brantford campus. I am in the user experience design program. On the side of my university life, I am a small business owner for a stationary business that Sells stickers, art prints and other items. I started this business a month before university started, and throughout learn I have also been running my business on Etsy. My company focuses a lot on artwork that I create myself. Growing up, I loved making art and doing new creations. I loved to play different sports and try new things, I played Ultimate frisbee during high school, and I want to continue playing in university on the Laurier team. I am also part of two excellent teams, the first one being UXDSA ( user experience design student association) for this club; I am the treasurer, and OGSA (Ontario Gujarati Student association) for this team am a graphic designer. 

## My Business 
##### Throughout my childhood, I loved to draw and make artwork, but that must be kids who like to do that kind of activity. For me, creating was a huge part of who I am. I look at things that I can fix or take that simple idea and make it my own. I can never sit still. I would be doing something with my hands or thinking. This relates to the business courses, as they taught me more about running a business in high school. I never knew that I would have my own business one day at the age of 18. It has been my dream to share my creativity and not just pick on items to focus on but multiply. All these activities that I did as a child and the courses I took helped me learn how to start a business and create mean full art that will impact others. 

## Resume 
#### I have not yet had a job; throughout high school, I have participated in many teams and clubs that have taught me skills. I have also Volunteered at daycare's taking care of kids.
